# Prework - Change My Background

Submitted by: **Pax Montoro**

**Change My Background** is an app that demonstrates the basics of iOS development using Xcode and Storyboards. It allows users to tap a button to change the background color of the screen dynamically. The app showcases how to connect UI elements to logic in Swift.

Time spent: **3 hours** spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My top 3 apps are: 

- Reddit
  - Wide variety of content
  - Intuitive UI  
- Instagram
  - Social aspect
  - Ability to edit photo and video content within the app
- Collectr
  - Fills a niche need to know trading card values
  - Tracks values of cards added to my collection almost like a stock portfolio
  - Can hold a massive amount of user data - I have scanned over 5.6k cards

My App Idea:

I have already started developing this for Android, but I see a need for a unit converter specifically for travellers that provides a quick and easy way to convert money, temperature, and distance. The goal is to have a slick, clean user interface that can be accessed quickly and offline. I plan to implement a button that allows the user to update the exchange rate before getting on the plane, which allows them to use the app offline if they should lose cell service.

## Notes

- The biggest challenge was getting familiar with connecting UI elements to Swift logic using the **Assistant Editor**. Learning the Control + Drag technique for IBAction connections was key.
- Xcode also threw some warnings until I made sure the **Is Initial View Controller** checkbox was selected in Storyboards.
- Experimenting with `UIColor` presets was a fun way to learn how Swift handles visuals.
