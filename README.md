## Notes

- The biggest challenge was getting familiar with connecting UI elements to Swift logic using the **Assistant Editor**. Learning the Control + Drag technique for IBAction connections was key.
- Xcode also threw some warnings until I made sure the **Is Initial View Controller** checkbox was selected in Storyboards.
- Experimenting with `UIColor` presets was a fun way to learn how Swift handles visuals.
